# Python API + PostgreSQL + Docker Sample App

To start up, make sure you have docker installed. Then simply run:
`docker compose up`

Once the application is up and running, go to:
`http://localhost:80/docs`

You'll be able to see the endpoints that have been made, and interact with them to create items (add them to the database) and retrieve existing items from the database.
